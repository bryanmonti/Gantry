Description:
Files:
* Arduino_Serial.cs (Converts text to serial data for Arduino Mega 2560)
* Program.cs (Main program)
* README (this file, duh)

Hardware:
* Xbox 360 Kinect
* A computer
* Arduino Mega 2560
* 2 x Makerbot v2.3 Stepper Drivers
* 2 x NEMA 23 Stepper Motors (diff torques)
* Couple of Servos

Languages:
* Arduino (C++)
* C# (C Sharp)
* Python (In later revisions)

Objectives:
1. Speech Recognition (Completed - March 19th, 2012: 10:16PM)
2. Speech to text to serial data (Work in progress)
3. Serial Data interpreted by Arduino and processed (Work in progress)

TODO: Merge Arduino_Serial and Program (Speech => Text => Serial => Arduino => ??? (interface?) => Profit)

Random notes: Arduino should have a feature where it looks for current state of something (whether or not the
shades have been dimmed or not, or whether the shades are open or closed).

List of commands and definitions:
1. Dim Plus Far Window Shades - 
2. Dim Minus Far Window Shades
3. Dim Plus Computer Window Shades
4. Dim Minus Computer Window Shades
5. Open Far Window Shades
6. Close Far Window Shades
7. Open Computer Window Shades
8. Close Computer Window Shades

How it all works and why: Yeah, give me a bit. Still waiting on Arduino board to come in the mail.
