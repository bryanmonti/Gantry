Objectives:
1. Speech Recognition (Completed - March 19th, 2012: 10:16PM)
2. Text to Serial (Completed 
3. Speech to text to serial data (Work in progress)
4. Serial Data interpreted by Arduino and processed (Work in progress; write arduino program)

TODO: Merge Arduino_Serial and Program (Speech => Text => Serial => Arduino => ??? (interface?) => Profit)

Random notes: Arduino should have a feature where it looks for current state of something (whether or not the
shades have been dimmed or not, or whether the shades are open or closed).
